            <div id="myths" class="tip-section">
                <h2 class="tip-title"><u>Myths & Facts</u></h2>
                <div class="tip-content">
                    <h3>1. Myth: Carbohydrates are often vilified in many popular diets, with claims that they cause weight gain and various health issues. Some believe that to lose weight or maintain a healthy lifestyle, one must avoid carbs altogether</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b>Carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient and a primary source of energy for the body. They play a crucial role in brain function, muscle activity, and overall energy levels. There are two main types of carbohydrates: simple and complex. Simple carbs, found in sugary snacks and refined grains, can lead to quick spikes in blood sugar levels and are often less nutritious. Complex carbs, found in whole grains, vegetables, and legumes, provide sustained energy and are packed with nutrients and fiber.</p>
                    <h3>2. Myth: There is a common belief that taking dietary supplements can provide all the nutrients the body needs, making a balanced diet unnecessary. Some people rely heavily on supplements, thinking they can make up for poor eating habits.</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b>While supplements can help fill specific nutrient gaps, they cannot replace the variety of nutrients and benefits provided by a balanced diet. Whole foods contain a complex combination of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that work together to promote health. Relying solely on supplements can lead to imbalances and potential health risks.</p>
                    <h3>3. Myth: For many years, dietary fat has been blamed for weight gain and various health problems. The misconception that eating fat directly translates to body fat has led many people to adopt low-fat diets.</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b>Not all fats are created equal, and dietary fat is essential for numerous bodily functions, including hormone production, nutrient absorption, and cell structure. Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, are beneficial and necessary for a balanced diet. It’s the type and amount of fat consumed, along with overall diet and lifestyle, that affect health and weight.</p>
                    <h3>4. Myth: Some people believe that skipping meals, especially breakfast, can help them lose weight by reducing their overall calorie intake. This approach is often seen as a quick fix for weight loss.</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b>Skipping meals can lead to increased hunger, overeating later in the day, and a slower metabolism. It can also result in nutrient deficiencies and decreased energy levels. Consistently eating balanced meals helps regulate blood sugar levels and supports a healthy metabolism.</p>
                    <h3>5. Myth: Avoid all fats if you’re trying to be healthy or lose weight.</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b> You don't need to avoid all fats to improve health or lose weight. Fats provide essential nutrients and should be part of a healthy diet, but they are high in calories, so limit their intake. Choose healthy fats like avocados, olives, or nuts, and opt for lower-fat versions of cheese and milk. Be mindful of food portions.</p>
                    <h3>6. Myth: We should only eat vegetables and avoid all non-vegetarian foods.</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b> Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets can be healthy if balanced properly. Non-vegetarian foods, such as lean meats, fish, and poultry, can provide essential nutrients like protein, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids. The key is to choose a variety of foods and maintain a balanced diet.</p>
                    <h3>7. Myth: Protein powder is only for bodybuilders and athletes.</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b> Protein powder can benefit anyone needing extra protein in their diet, not just bodybuilders and athletes. It can help with muscle repair, weight management, and meeting daily protein needs, especially for those with dietary restrictions or increased protein requirements. However, it should be used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, whole foods.</p>
                    <h3>8. Myth: Corn Flakes is good for health.</h3>
                    <p><b>Fact:</b> Oats and Muesli offer more nutritional benefits compared to Corn Flakes. Corn Flakes are low in fiber and high in sugar, which can cause blood sugar spikes. In contrast, Oats provide fiber that aids digestion and maintains stable blood sugar levels, while Muesli offers a mix of whole grains, nuts, seeds, and dried fruit, providing a broader range of nutrients.</p>

                    <h3>1. Dont's: Avoid Using Plastic and Disposable Items for Food and Drinks</h3>
                    <p>Do not use plastic fiber plates, bowls, plastic tiffin boxes, paper plates, plastic spoons, plastic containers, or polythene bags to eat, store, or heat food. Avoid using plastic glasses, paper cups for hot beverages, and plastic bottles to drink or carry water. Microplastics from these items can enter our bodies through food and water, posing health risks. Additionally, plastic causes pollution and is non-biodegradable.</p>
                    <h3>Do's: Switch to Healthier Utensils and Containers</h3>
                    <p>Replace all plastic items with utensils, containers, plates, and spoons made of stainless steel, glass, brass, copper, or clay. Water bottles should also be switched to stainless steel or copper. Using copper, brass, and clay items offers additional health benefits.</p>

                    <p>8. Avoid using table salt or decrease its intake as it has high sodium. If needed replace it with good quality(quite expesive) salt with low sodium level. Best use black salt, rock salt which has no sodium and it has the required minerals</p>
                    <p>9. Try to avoid eating Maida or consume it in less quantity. As it has no fibre or least nutrient which has not good for health. Better eat wheat or atta.</p>
                    <p>10. Avoid using pressure cookers to cook food as most of the nutrients get destroyed due to high pressure and temperature.</p>
                    <p>11. Avoid using any soaps. Use only body soaps or toilet soaps which has high TFM or grade 1 soaps.</p>

                    <p>13. Avoid drinking tap water as it is hard water as well as it is not filtered which can cause any illness due to the presence of Impurities.</p>
                    <p>14. Must have a TDS meter at every home so that you can check the quality of water used for drinking or cooking from tap, jar bottles or RO water purifiers.</p>
                    <p>15. Keep a distance of atleast 25-30 cm from eyes while looking at any screen or reading books.</p>
                    <p>16. Don’t put sharp or pointed objects to scratch or clean ears. It can can damage to the ear drum resulting in permanent hearing loss. Use only cotton bars instead.</p>

                    <p>31. Clean your comb once twice a week or once in a month.</p>
                    <p>32. Don’t put hot water in the head or on the hairs. It can cause permanent hairloss.</p>
                    <p>33. Don’t use hairoil to oil the hair more than thrice a week. As our hairs have oil glands which secretes oils naturally and provide the required nutrients to the hairs. Over oiling may cause clogged pores and stops the air to pass which result in dandruff and hairfall. </p>

                <h2 class="tip-title"><u>Scientific Research</u></h2>
                <div class="tip-content">
                    <h3>Research 1</h3>
                    <p>Studies, such as those published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), highlight that carbohydrates, especially complex carbs found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, are essential for energy and overall health. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber are linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.</p>
                    <h3>Research 2</h3>
                    <p>Nutritional science, including studies from the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) are crucial for cell function, hormone production, and nutrient absorption. Diets rich in healthy fats, like the Mediterranean diet, are associated with reduced heart disease risk and better overall health.</p>
                    <h3>Research 3</h3>
                    <p>Research in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition emphasizes that while supplements can address specific deficiencies, they cannot replicate the complex mix of nutrients in whole foods. Diets rich in whole foods are associated with better health outcomes than reliance on supplements alone.</p>
                    <h3>Research 4</h3>
                    <p>Studies published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition show that skipping meals often leads to increased hunger, overeating, and metabolic disruption. Regular meal patterns, including a healthy breakfast, support better weight management and metabolic health.</p>

                    <p>The Benefits of Outdoor Play for Children's Eye Health. Evidence: Playing outside is beneficial for children's eye health as it reduces the risk of myopia, provides essential exposure to natural light, encourages physical activity, and balances visual demands. In contrast, indoor activities and prolonged screen time can strain the eyes and increase the risk of developing myopia.</p>

                <div class="tip-content">
                    <h3>1. No coffee or tea on an empty stomach or just before a meal:</h3>
                    <p>Coffee or tea can be suitable for some people when consumed consciously, considering their health and the season. Drinking it on an empty stomach can worsen issues, especially if you have an acidic digestive system. It's better to have coffee or tea with food or after breakfast.</p>
                    <h3>2. Don’t drink water for 1.5 hours after food:</h3>
                    <p>Avoid drinking water for 1.5 hours after meals. Drinking water right after eating can dilute digestive juices and impact digestion, potentially leading to weight gain over time.</p>
                    <h3>3. Sleep by 10 p.m.</h3>
                    <p>It's beneficial to go to bed by 10 p.m. Ayurveda suggests that sleep is influenced by kapha dosha. People with a kapha body type tend to sleep more, while those with pitta or vata body types sleep less. The period from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. is dominated by kapha, making it an ideal time for everyone to sleep, as this increases the likelihood of a good night's rest.</p>
                    <h3>4. Strictly Eat Three Meals a Day.</h3>
                    <p>Eating at proper times is important for health. Meals should be spaced out, avoiding food intake within three hours of the previous meal to prevent indigestion (rasodvega). Improperly digested food can be harmful and potentially life-threatening.</p>
                    <h3>5. Have Freshly Prepared Food</h3>
                    <p>Avoid bread, biscuits, and all other packaged food items. Hot food increases the agni or metabolic fire on entering the belly (stomach). This in turn sets right the metabolism, enhances appetite and capacity to digest food. It also expels the vitiated vayu and reduces or destroys the vitiated kapha, and keeps it under balance.</p>
