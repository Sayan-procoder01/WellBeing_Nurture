                <h2 class="tip-title">Myths & Facts</h2>
                <div class="tip-content">
                    <h3>1. Myth: Avoid all fats if you’re trying to be healthy or lose weight.</h3>
                    <p>Fact: You don't need to avoid all fats to improve health or lose weight. Fats provide essential nutrients and should be part of a healthy diet, but they are high in calories, so limit their intake. Choose healthy fats like avocados, olives, or nuts, and opt for lower-fat versions of cheese and milk. Be mindful of food portions.</p>
                    <h3>2. Myth: We should only eat vegetables and avoid all non-vegetarian foods.</h3>
                    <p>Fact: Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets can be healthy if balanced properly. Non-vegetarian foods, such as lean meats, fish, and poultry, can provide essential nutrients like protein, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids. The key is to choose a variety of foods and maintain a balanced diet.</p>
                    <h3>3. Myth: Protein powder is only for bodybuilders and athletes.</h3>
                    <p>Fact: Protein powder can benefit anyone needing extra protein in their diet, not just bodybuilders and athletes. It can help with muscle repair, weight management, and meeting daily protein needs, especially for those with dietary restrictions or increased protein requirements. However, it should be used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, whole foods.</p>
                    <h3>4. Myth: Corn Flakes is good for health.</h3>

                    <h3>1. Dont's: Avoid Using Plastic and Disposable Items for Food and Drinks</h3>
                    <p>Do not use plastic fiber plates, bowls, plastic tiffin boxes, paper plates, plastic spoons, plastic containers, or polythene bags to eat, store, or heat food. Avoid using plastic glasses, paper cups for hot beverages, and plastic bottles to drink or carry water. Microplastics from these items can enter our bodies through food and water, posing health risks. Additionally, plastic causes pollution and is non-biodegradable.</p>
                    <h3>Do's: Switch to Healthier Utensils and Containers</h3>
                    <p>Replace all plastic items with utensils, containers, plates, and spoons made of stainless steel, glass, brass, copper, or clay. Water bottles should also be switched to stainless steel or copper. Using copper, brass, and clay items offers additional health benefits.</p>

                    <p>31. Clean your comb once twice a week or once in a month.</p>
                    <p>32. Don’t put hot water in the head or on the hairs. It can cause permanent hairloss.</p>
                    <p>33. Don’t use hairoil to oil the hair more than thrice a week. As our hairs have oil glands which secretes oils naturally and provide the required nutrients to the hairs. Over oiling may cause clogged pores and stops the air to pass which result in dandruff and hairfall. </p>

In contrast, indoor activities and prolonged screen time can strain the eyes and increase the risk of developing myopia.</p>

                <h2 class="tip-title">Ayurveda Health Tips</h2>
                <div class="tip-content">
                    <h3>1. No coffee or tea on an empty stomach or just before a meal:</h3>
                    <p>Coffee or tea can be suitable for some people when consumed consciously, considering their health and the season. Drinking it on an empty stomach can worsen issues, especially if you have an acidic digestive system. It's better to have coffee or tea with food or after breakfast.</p>
                    <h3>2. Don’t drink water for 1.5 hours after food:</h3>
                    <p>Avoid drinking water for 1.5 hours after meals. Drinking water right after eating can dilute digestive juices and impact digestion, potentially leading to weight gain over time.</p>
                    <h3>3. Sleep by 10 p.m.</h3>
                    <p>It's beneficial to go to bed by 10 p.m. Ayurveda suggests that sleep is influenced by kapha dosha. People with a kapha body type tend to sleep more, while those with pitta or vata body types sleep less. The period from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. is dominated by kapha, making it an ideal time for everyone to sleep, as this increases the likelihood of a good night's rest.</p>
                    <h3>4. Strictly Eat Three Meals a Day.</h3>
                    <p>Eating at proper times is important for health. Meals should be spaced out, avoiding food intake within three hours of the previous meal to prevent indigestion (rasodvega). Improperly digested food can be harmful and potentially life-threatening.</p>
                    <h3>5. Have Freshly Prepared Food</h3>
                    <p>Avoid bread, biscuits, and all other packaged food items. Hot food increases the agni or metabolic fire on entering the belly (stomach). This in turn sets right the metabolism, enhances appetite and capacity to digest food. It also expels the vitiated vayu and reduces or destroys the vitiated kapha, and keeps it under balance.</p>
